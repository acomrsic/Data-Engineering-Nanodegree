# Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres

### Description
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user 
activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in 
understanding what songs users are listening to. 
They'd like to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries 
on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. I need to create a database schema and
ETL pipeline for this analysis. 

--------------------------------------------

#### Datasets

##### Song Dataset
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. 
The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

Example:
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

##### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in 
the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths
to two files in this dataset.
Example: 
```
{"artist":null,"auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Walter","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Frye","length":null,"level":"free","location":"San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA","method":"GET","page":"Home","registration":1540919166796.0,"sessionId":38,"song":null,"status":200,"ts":1541105830796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"39"}
```
